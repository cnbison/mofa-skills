# MoFA FM

Voice management and text-to-speech with custom voice cloning support via OminiX-MLX on Apple Silicon.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech** with preset or custom voices
- **Voice Cloning**: Upload a 3-10s audio clip, save it as a named voice, reuse it anytime
- **Voice Management**: Save, list, and delete custom voice profiles

## Preset Voices

vivian (default), serena, ryan, aiden, eric, dylan, uncle_fu, ono_anna, sohee

## Custom Voice Workflow

1. User sends a voice clip (3-10 seconds of clear speech)
2. Agent calls `fm_voice_save` with the audio path and a name
3. For TTS, agent calls `fm_tts` with `voice` set to the saved name
4. List all voices with `fm_voice_list`
5. Delete a voice with `fm_voice_delete`

## Configuration

Set `OMINIX_API_URL` to point to the ominix-api server (default: `http://localhost:8080`).
Set `CREW_DATA_DIR` for per-profile voice storage (set automatically by crew gateway).
